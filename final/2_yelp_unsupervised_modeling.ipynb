Positive reviews seem to be mostly characterized by **emotional adjectives** (e.g. *delicious*, *friendly*), differently from neutral and negative reviews that present terms that are more related to the **operational effectiveness** of the cafe (e.g. *time*, *minutes*). Thinking from the customer's perspective this actually makes sense: to really love a cafe or restaurant, we must have had an emotional connection to it - something more than merely getting a decent cup of coffee. Instead, when we really dislike a place, it's often because of significant reasons related to the place not meeting basic customer expectations (e.e. long waiting time, poor quality)."

    "* **Topic 4**: this is not as straightforward as the previous topic but we have a few terms that refer to **sweet items or ice cream** (words *cream*, *waffle*, *caramel*, *cone*, *scoop*, *strawberry*)\n",
    "* **Topic 5**: offering **books or other items** (words *book*, *store*, *bookstore*, *selection*)\n",
    "* **Topic 6**: split between **location** (words *spot*, *place*, *location*, *neighborhood*) and **atmosphere/service** (words *staff*, *friendly*, *service*, *helpful*)\n",
    "* **Topic 7**: quality of the **service** and the customer experience. Note that 4 out of the 15 top words revolve around *time* (words *time*,*minutes*, *wait*, *hour*).\n",
    "* **Topic 8**: strong signal towards **sweet items or pastries** (words *chocolate*, *pie*, *sweet*, *cookie*, *cake*, *dessert*). This topic seems to have a stronger signal on sweetness than topic 1 and topic 4, which present a lower number of words specifically related to sweet items.\n",

    "We're already getting a pretty good signal from this baseline topic modeling. However, there is definitely margin for optimization: we already see some topic duplication around *sweet items* (Topic 1, 4, 8 with Topic 8 showing the strongest signal) and *service* (Topic 6 and 7 with Topic 7 showing the strongest signal). This is an indication of the fact that we should test towards having a lower number of topics so as to **centralize and separate the signal** even more."

Coffee places, especially if in the same city (on average, an espresso in Rome, Italy is definitely cheaper than an espresso in Portland, US), tend to be characterized by relatively homogeneous pricing. This likely why pricing does not appear as a major term in reviews: it tends not to be a differentiating element across cafes in the same city."

    "> These two places seem to be two institutions for Portland. It's therefore undertandable that a lot of reviews are talking about these places, either to comment on them specifically or to use them as an item of comparison. Interestingly, and more from a business perspective, when a specific spot becomes so popular that it ends up characterizing the social fabric of a city, its competitors will likely need to adjust their offerings to steal part of the incumbent's market share. Therefore, offering **delicious doughnuts** (to compete with Voodoo) or a **curated selection of books/magazines** (to compete with Powell's) could be an interesting idea for an existing or a new cafe in Portland."
